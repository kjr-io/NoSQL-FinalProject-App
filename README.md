# NoSQL-FinalProject
This reposity contains the final project for CISC 5640 NoSQL Database Systems at Fordham University. The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in creating a web-based application using a document database as the back-end. This project will use the aforementioned lightweight document database as the location in which the front-end will retrieve the item information. The webpage will provide the GUI to perform CRUD operations on the items. The movie review website will have a finite set of movies and users. The user will be able to rate a movie and add a comment to each movie. The database will be updated with the latest ratings and user comments.
